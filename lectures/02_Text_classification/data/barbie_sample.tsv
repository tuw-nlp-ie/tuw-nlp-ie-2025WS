It was just a mess! This movie is not even a comedy. It contains very weird humour. I felt very disappointed when the movie ended... It looks more like a video clip than a movie. The only thing I liked was the effects and the direction. However it' s not enough to make a nice film! The story was worse than a kids cartoon... The writer wanted to make a movie about feminism but he did not make it in the end. If he had written a more interesting story it would be different. Also, if I had watched this movie at the cinema I am sure that I had left at the break. Anyway it is just a very bad movie with unfunny jokes. It is so overrated an much discussed, however I believe the opposite!	negative
From where to even begin? The movie is absolutely immaculate. The acting is beyond reasonable. I would say that perhaps this Greta's most loved film but that would be an extreme allegation considering the public opinion. The movie roars out of the gate with an inventiveness and energy which perhaps the audience was not all set for. The film spreads its politics explicitly, using rudimentary ideas about the performance of gender, gender inequality and consumerism to fuel the plot and inform its comic beats. You would even forget that the movie is actually, and in essence, about a doll because the plot is quite indulging. What i admired most is Helen Mirren performing the narration, not to forget that the casting was also impressive.	positive
I really enjoyed this little thing! It is silly, kitschy as hell - BUT! Definitely FUN! Entertaining! Dare I say, perhaps Even... Thought provoking? It IS a "Pink strawberry bubblegum" version of "Social commentary" and perhaps even a bit of gender role Stereotypes criticism? Margot Robbie is excellent and Ryan Reynolds is good in their respective roles! The scenography, music and filming is excellent! I Would be surprised if this film does not reel in a couple of awards! I would truly enjoy watching THIS together with some children and young people and hear what they say about it! AND I would feel totally comfortable with that they would have a good time without being overwhelmed! I myself actually found the gender Stereotypes social commentary interesting and perhaps even, dare I say a bit thought provoking and inspiring! IS this a "GREAT FILM"? - NO. BUT! IT IS FUN, Entertaining and good fun for the head! I CAN EASILY with good conscience recommend this film as fun entertainment! A Kitchy, plasticky pastiche - without becoming annoying, tiresome or boring!	positive
Context: I'm a single, straight, childless, 40+ yo dude who rides motorcycles, does kickboxing, and drinks my whisky neat. So I'm probably not what you would think is the target audience, which is why I went in with a "let's see what the fuss is all about" attitude more than genuine interest. What a surprise! They made it very fun and entertaining and I truly laughed out loud at a few jokes. I also really appreciated the message, though a bit on the nose at times. While the plot, directing, and production value are good, it really is the cast that is selling this movie and I applaud all of them, supporting characters included. A bit surprisingly, my only word of warning: I would probably not let younger children watch it as some jokes and overall storyline might not be for them.	positive
Barbie is a movie that challenges us to think outside the Barbie box. Fabulous concept, an iconic character. By flipping the script and swapping societal roles, it invites us to question the norms and expectations we've grown accustomed to. There is a deeper message tucked away in this pink-tastic extravaganza. This fresh perspective adds a lot of fun to the wild world of gender stereotypes, highlighting the absurdity of these rigid societal norms. However, while Barbie is undeniably enjoyable to watch, I did find it slightly lacking in terms of developing its own central theme. The film sets up the premise of "finding happiness inside not outside," but I personally felt that it didn't fully deliver on this promise. Maybe it would've benefited from an additional 15-20 minutes in the third act to provide a more conclusive resolution to the story. Unfortunately, Greta Gerwig only touched the surface of what she intended to do. While it may have fallen slightly short in fully developing its central idea, it compensates with its glorious and absurd nature. It is a fun and lighthearted movie that raises important questions about gender. The vibrant pink aesthetic adds to its charm, creating a visually stunning world that is both compelling and whimsical. P. S. Ryan Gosling definitely stole the show. This Ken is an absolute riot with his obsession over horses.	positive
Ignoring all the controversies and looking at this just as a movie, the overall feeling I had while wathcing it was sheer boredeom. Every single dialogue and scene was predictable and even the songs and humor fell flat most of the time. There was nothing much to do for actors as all are cartoonish. The social commentary had no subtelty and just tried to hit you hard with the messaging with no deep insight or thought put in. The set design in Barbieland is the only saving grace in this move and also the iconic opening score insipred by 2001 A Space Odyssey! Hats off to the marketing team for this movie, who made sure that everone was talking about it and sustained the interest.	negative
OMG, how bad is this? 3/10 is a good rating for a movie like this one compared to a GOOD MOVIE! Cant belive people like this. The whole thing lacked a strong story and any sort of narrative impetus. It really was very tedious, with same scene content played over and over again. The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and doll movements from the cast but even this got tiresome. The cast tried their best with the material, but to my mind Margot Robbie has done two duff movies in a row, this and Babylon. I am being to think she lacks good judgement and any acting heft. In terms of other reviewers on here, they were watching a different movie and judging the vague thematic material as a plus because it looked out the power dynamic between men and women, forgetting the exploration undertaken in this movie was a historical perspective from the 1960's, when Barbie was invented and really had little application in 2023. In summation it was style over substance, it lacked humour and story and indeed anything memorable. At best this is a 3 outta 10 for the dance sequences.	negative
Barbie What a confusing mess, firstly to be a comedy it must pass the minimum bar of 6 out loud laughs per movie, I laughed twice. The humour employed was largely slapstick and situational irony, it had roughly the same feel as the surreality of a Wes Anderson movie, but without his touch. The whole thing lacked a strong story and any sort of narrative impetus. It really was very tedious, with much the same scene content played over and over again. The styling was good as was some of the dance routines and stylised doll movements from the cast, but even this got tiresome.

Barbie (2023) offers a vibrant and empowering cinematic experience, delving deep into the themes of women empowerment and self-discovery. The movie serves as a poignant reminder of the valuable lessons it imparts to its audience. Through an engaging narrative, the film explores the resilience and strength of its characters, particularly Barbie, as they navigate the complexities of the world around them. The movie's strengths lie in its exceptional cast and impeccable direction. The actors bring their characters to life with remarkable depth, making it easy for the audience to connect with their journeys. The attention to detail in the Barbie world is awe-inspiring, capturing the essence of the beloved toy and its universe. Every frame is meticulously crafted, mirroring the way real-life enthusiasts play with their Barbie dolls. However, the film's climax leaves something to be desired. The resolution feels somewhat abrupt, leaving the audience yearning for a more satisfying conclusion. It's akin to being left in the middle of a captivating story, with questions lingering in the air. While the movie successfully conveys its message, the execution of the final act could have been more polished to provide a more fulfilling viewing experience. One of the movie's standout moments involves Barbie's venture into the real world, showcasing her bravery and determination as she strives to make a difference. Yet, despite the film's best efforts, this pivotal moment lacks the emotional connection needed to truly resonate with the audience. The resolution of their struggles and the restoration of happiness, although achieved, feel somewhat disconnected, leaving viewers wanting more closure. In the grand scheme of things, Barbie (2023) stands as a commendable cinematic creation, not without its flaws but brimming with potential. The film earns praise for its outstanding performances, meticulous direction, and faithful portrayal of the Barbie universe. While it may not reach the heights of a cinematic masterpiece, it undoubtedly serves as a thought-provoking and visually captivating piece of storytelling. In conclusion, I would rate Barbie (2023) a 7 out of 10. It might not achieve perfection, but it offers a unique and engaging perspective, making it a must-watch for enthusiasts and curious minds alike. Give it a chance; you might find yourself pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even inspired. Thank you for reading my review. Love you .	positive
I saw this recently on streaming after hearing so much hype about how it was so important and such an incredible movie. After I watched it I wondered if I'd ordered the wrong movie. The whole thing was just lame unfunny jokes, a convoluted plot line, bland acting and mixed messaging which seems to be trying to be positive for women but are unintentionally negative - especially at the end with how the Barbies trick the Kens, I mean is the positive message for my daughter meant to be to exploit men by buttering them up? Er what? Reviews for this were glowingly positive and I pretty much disagreed with all of them, but even the negative reviews praised the set design and Barbie land, personally I didn't see the big deal, like they copied how the dream houses look and made a set of it. Whoopty do. The two stars are mostly for Ryan Gosling and Allan (I forget the actors name) as they were the best part of the movie, even though Gosling Ken strolling was sad to me. Which is ironic given it was meant to be a movie about empowering women. Disappointing and I expect this movie to be re evaluated as bad in the future.	negative
